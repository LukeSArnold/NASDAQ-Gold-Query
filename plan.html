			<h1> Phase 0: Requirement Specifications </h1>
				The main purpose of the assignement is to take a users weight, convert that into
				troy ounces, and use that to determine how much they're worhtin gold. 
				Will pull information from NASDAQ with an api

				A good solution properly calculates the value, and prints it to the screen with a 
				removeable DIV element.

				I don't have much of any experience with JSON files, nor APIS, so I'm a bit worried that 
				I won't know how to properly parse this information and make the needed parsing. 
			</pre>

			<h1> Phase 1: System Analysis </h1>
		
				The main information that the program takes in consists of the following
					1. The data from the user specifying the amount of weight to
						convert
					2. The actual NASDAQ worth of gold per troy ounce
					3. The data from the unitconversion
						- includes url parameters (to, from, and value)
						- includes model information for conversion factors

				The output will take the form of DIV elements, these will present the proper worth
				of the given weight in gold. Additionally, invalid inputs will register as red div elements
				informing the user they've made an error.

				The alogrithms will consist of method to retrieve the price of gold from NASDAQ, and also 
				another algorithm to make a call to unitconv app to perform the necessary conversion from 
				whatever the user given weight is into troy ounces. From there we will use the price of 
				gold from NASDAQ and times it by the weight (now appearing in troy ounces) to properly tell
				the user how much they would weight in gold.

			<h1> Phase 2: Design </h1>

				INDEX.html
				==========================================
				create main div for first element
				create a h2 element to serve as a main header detailing what the 
					program is
				Create an input field with the type set to numeric
				Create a menu item with all different weight options as select elements
				Create a main button

				Script.js
				========================================
				Start by initalizing a fetch() to the nasdaq datalink
					the next step in the chain will be taking this response
					and using it to instatiate a json object to manage the data

				From there once the fetch is complete, use the infromation found within the JSON file to update
				the value of the gold price as it appears on the main screen

				Create a function that is called when the button is pressed
					The function will take the value from the 
					weight input widget, as well as the unit found within the menu. 
					Using this information a fetch() call will be made to the unitconv app.

					Once this call is finished take the new weight as it appears in troy ounces, 
					multiply the troy ounce amount with the current price of gold as previously calculated.
					Then create a new div which displays the current price as the text content. 

					div.textContent = `${price}`
					div.setAttribute(onclick = function {
						div.remove()
						});
					document.body.appendChild(div)
			
				If the value passed into the main input is not a number, the function will not call. once the button
				is pressed we check to see if the input is either NaN or just an empty string. Depending
				on this we instead create a new div that doesn't contain any information but is still removed on
				click

				var div = document.createElement('div');
				div.setAttribute('style','background-color: #FF0000')
				div.setAttribute('onclick',function {
					div.remove9)
					});
				document.body.appendChild(div)

			<h1> Phase 4: Testing and Debugging </h1>
			<p>
			Most of the issues I encountered while writing the program came mainly from issues regarding my 
			api functionality (in the case of the unitconv app), and with USING an api (in the case of the 
			main NASDAQ data retrieval).

			For the unitconv app I had a lot of issues and confusion while trying to convert the content
			I needed to retrieve into a JSON object. I was confused on how to return a GET request (even though
			we've been doing it all semester, I think I just didn't fully comprehend what a HttpResonse was), and as 
			a result I had a lot of difficulty. 

			With the main NASDAQ api retrieval I realized that I messed up the URL I was using to retrieve the data,
			the issue is that it still worked, I just formatted the API key a little bit wrong and as a result NASDAQ
			recognized me as an anonymous user, so part way through production my API key expired because I technically
			never had one. Big mess

			Other than that I didn't run into too many other problems, besides just figuring out how to write the program.

			<h1> Phase 6: Maintenance </h1>
			<p>
			WHAT PARTS OF YOUR PROGRAM ARE SLOPPILY WRITTEN AND HARD TO UNDERSTAND
				- Defiently a lot of parts of my program could be improved with formatting. While
				  writing the program I ran into a lot of issues I didn't initially expect and the 
				  dataflow ended up being different than I expected. As a result the code probably looks
				  jumbled, this is because It ended up being in a different eorder than I originally expected. 

				  So some of the parts of my main javascript code is a bit confusing because of the order of everyting
			
			WILL YOUR DOCUMENTATION MAKE SENSE TO:
				- I think because the code I wrote is pretty simple, everything will remain pretty easy to understand.
				  I definetly could've included more comments or adjusted formatting a bit, but I still think the code
				  will make sense to myself, and most everyone in time

			The program will continue to work indefinetly, unless DJANGO changes radically, or javascript is 
			radically changed

			Adding in a new feature will be really easy. Most of the existing functions pretty well on its own, so
			adding in a new feature wouldn't disrupt the existing dataflow
