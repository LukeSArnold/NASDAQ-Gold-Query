* Data conversion came from duckdcukgo.com built in data conversion widget 

This projects was created as an assignment for **CS-2610** web development class at USU. The program takes in a user's weight
in their respective weight measurement, and then tells the user what their weight is worth in gold using the current worth of 
gold. 

The program utilizes multiple APIs. Firstly, the program takes in the users weight, using another site (also hosted by this program)
the users weight is converted into troy ounces. Once the amount of troy ounces is determined, the program connects to the NASDAQ
datalink and finds the current price of gold for one troy ounce. Using all of this information the program prints to the user
their worth in gold.
